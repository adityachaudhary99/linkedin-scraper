Here\u2019s how:\n\nLast week, I mentioned Todd Busler\u2019s post where he highlighted that the number of individuals with the ability to sign off on a deal has dropped from 15-20 \u2192 3 in the past few years. \n\nAs a sales community, we HAVE to think about power differently in order to survive (and hit quota).\u00a0 \n\nIt was never about you or me getting our deals done.\n\nIt's always been about the art of aligning diverse priorities within a buyer committee.\n\nNow that it\u2019s such a select few, getting their priorities straight matters more than ever.\n\nThat\u2019s what modern multithreading is all about: \n\n\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc26 \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d\n\nEach person brings their own set of motivations \u2014\u00a0both personal and professional \u2014 to the table. Here\u2019s a real-world example:\n\n\u2022 Director of Sales \u2192 Wants their team to follow repeatable account mapping practices\u2014but it\u2019s manual and being ignored.\n\u2022 VP of Sales \u2192 Prefers to spend more time with family, rather than repetitive 1:1s and inefficient deal reviews.\n\u2022 CRO \u2192 Primarily focused on deal conversion and topline revenue impact.\n\nRecognizing these differences is crucial, as they influence how you approach each stakeholder.\n\nBut the real challenge lies in crafting your communication in a way that speaks directly to each individual. \n\nWhen you can weave together the individual stories and align them with your value proposition, you create a compelling case that gets everyone excited about signing off.\n\nThat\u2019s the magic moment that Centralize (YC W24) makes possible, for every single deal, not just your top 5.\n\nWe aggregate all of your conversations (Gong, Slack, Gmail, etc.) into a deal cockpit so you know where you\u2019re not multithreaded, what your key stakeholders care about, and how to leverage your team\u2019s network to get to power.\n\nWant to see it in action?

Here's why weekends are our secret weapon:\n\nAt Centralize (YC W24), moving fast is core to our DNA. It's a skill that we've honed scaling 0 -> 1 products at Meta and Slack, like Facebook Shops and Huddles.\n\nIronically, high speed requires slowing down at first: deep reflection, focus, and team alignment. None of those are easy to come by throughout the week \u2014\u00a0back to back demos, customer onboardings, and relentless execution take up 90% of the week.\n\nSo when Friday evening rolled around a few days ago, I was stoked.

The platform maps out every contact, every conversation, and each person's priority within the account, all at a glance. It\u2019s like getting a real-time, AI-powered account plan, an idea that I've been thinking of for a while.  Rachit and his team at Centralize did a way better job than I ever could. \n\nImagine working on a deal and knowing exactly who on your team already has strong connections to the decision-makers, champions, and blockers in the account. No more guessing, no more crossed wires\u2014just a clean, centralized map of connections and insights that you can use to influence deals, renewals, & churn.\n\nAs we discussed, so much of sales tech has focused on tracking data for managers and less on fostering relationships\u2014Centralize\u2019s approach could change that. It\u2019s not about more data; it\u2019s about actionable relationship intelligence, plain and simple.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to boost your win rates and expand multi-threaded engagement in your accounts, take a closer look at Centralize. \ud83d\udc40 \n\nHas anyone else experimented with team-selling tools like this?

But with so many cool tools on the market like:\n\n- AI SDRs (like TOPO YC 24 and Artisan from my YC batch)\n- Sendspark AI Videos (shoutout to my faves Bethany Stachenfeld and Melissa Gaglione\u2728)\n- Apollo.io\u2019s Enrichment Credits and Power-Ups\n- Adam Robinson\u2019s Inbound Led Outbound with RB2B \n\nIt\u2019s becoming more complex, and noisy.\n\nThese tools are pretty powerful at what they do.

Usually three reasons:\n\n* Cost of inaction < cost of change (change is hard) \n\n* Problem isn't big enough or it doesn't impact enough people in the org \n(nice-to-have vs. must-have)\n\n* Limited organizational exposure (talking to too few people)\n\nHere's how to tackle this:\n+ Reality check: Is the problem you're solving truly critical for your prospects? If not, find companies where this problem really matters - where there's real, quantifiable pain.\n\n+ Get alignment on the problem. You need everyone involved in the conversation to agree that this is a problem worth solving right now (over other problems). Most organizations can't agree on their most urgent problems, let alone department-level issues. Without buying group alignment, you're going nowhere.\n\n+ Expand your reach. We often spend time talking to just one or two people because they're our target persona, they engage, they get the problem, love our demo, agree with everything. But they're never the only decision-maker. You have to know who you don't know who could impact or influence the deal. Btw there's a product called Centralize (YC W24) that can help you with this ... it's really slick. \n\n+ Focus on \"why change?\" You need to hear in their words why they think changing might make sense. Getting them to deeply understand the true cost of inaction might get them to want to take action. Most don't grasp the true cost because it doesn't directly impact them.\n\nPro tip: Address this early. Be upfront. \"There is a greater than 50% that you'll stick with what you're currently doing right now. My job is to help you make a conscious decision, even if that decision is to keep doing what you're doing.\" \n\nRemember your job as a seller is to help guide your prospect to make a decision because no one likes no decision. \n\n#urgencyisdeveloped #multithreadnow\n\nI'll pick up my regular weekly cadence of posting now that I'm back from Nashville after spending time with my friends at Ambition at the PEAK conference - you need to go next year - it's the best conference of the year - right Jen Allen-Knuth Lauren Bailey \ud83d\ude0d", "time": "1 week ago", "urn": "7257135930841473024"}, {"images": [], "num_appreciations": 1, "num_comments": 11, "num_empathy": 5, "num_interests": 1, "num_likes": 31, "num_praises": 4, "num_reposts": 3, "post_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7257017087276003328/", "posted": "2024-10-29 13:15:02", "poster_linkedin_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachitkataria", "reshared": false, "text": "It took 3 weeks to realize my\u00a0CRO\u00a0was connected to the decision maker of our\u00a0biggest deal last quarter.\n\nIt should have taken minutes.\n\nI recently had a conversation with a VP of Revenue who shared this exact,\u00a0frustrating experience.\n\nThis video shares the full story \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffd\n\nHow\u00a0do you sell as a team and make sure you're not missing\u00a0valuable intros to multithread deals?", "time": "1 week ago", "urn": "7257017087276003328", "video": {"duration": 46333, "stream_url": "https://dms.licdn.com/playlist/vid/v2/D5605AQGGrfC6kOEjjA/mp4-720p-30fp-crf28/mp4-720p-30fp-crf28/0/1730183360905?e=1731524400&v=beta&t=QaKQ8oSqpPeIiHmxy5-OayXpZTjFlGofqeh6ag6Tt6k"}}, {"images": [{"url": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQFbggcZsx08xw/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1730092377954?e=1733961600&v=beta&t=dUyUfH8t9HY4D1ev0Uv-IKT_o3FoJX_9EoytAGAN6Zg"}], "num_comments": 19, "num_empathy": 12, "num_likes": 55, "num_praises": 3, "num_reposts": 2, "post_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7256654690963083264/", "posted": "2024-10-28 13:15:00", "poster_linkedin_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachitkataria", "reshared": false, "text": "8 days into YC, I was in Napa Valley carving a solid block of ice. 9 months later, I finally get why we spent that hour chipping away \ud83e\udd76\n\nIt was Day 2 of the YC retreat, a tradition that kicks off each batch. I scanned the day\u2019s activities, and when I saw ice carving had just started, I sprinted over to give it a shot.\n\nIn no time, Nanki Grewal, Robin Seitz, and I were flinging bits of ice everywhere. I chiseled, Nanki cleared the shavings, and Robin smoothed things down.\n\nAn hour later, we had our masterpiece: the Y Combinator logo. \n\nFun fact: what we sculpted is called a relief. It\u2019s a style of carving where the image emerges, as if it was always hidden inside the block, waiting to be revealed.\n\nBuilding a startup feels a lot like that.\n\nYou start with endless ambiguity, pick a direction, and chip away. Get customer feedback, pivot, keep going. Get more input, adjust your angle. Continue grinding.\n\nSlowly, something recognizable takes shape.

Every leader is competing for the same resources, so make your solution their top priority. \n\nEven better, solve broader problems across multiple functions, and get joint budget.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Procurement can\u2019t approve your deal, but they can kill it\n\nMost teams treat procurement as an afterthought but getting them involved early removes last-minute roadblocks.\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 The SPICED framework by Winning by Design is more relevant than ever \n\nSPICED (Situation, Pain, Impact, Critical Event, Decision) is essential for uncovering gaps in deals.

All of GTM should have the same context at all times across accounts.\n\n\u2022 Sales, marketing and CS often operate in silos when they should be a united front to prospects\u00a0\n\u2022 Lack of real-time visibility into accounts creates hours of tedious handoff, a game of revenue \u201cTelephone\u201d up the chain, and stalled deals\n\u2022 Julianne Tajuba, MBA, MSPH at mParticle knows how powerful it is when sales & marketing are aligned \u2014 it ensures consistent outbound messaging and coordinated ABM campaigns\n\n2. Visualizing org charts to spot stakeholder whitespace is nearly impossible.\n\n\u2022 Teams lack real-time tools that map contacts in the same place as activities\n\u2022 Expanding within accounts feels like navigating in the dark without a flashlight\n\u2022 The few teams that do have a comprehensive view see exponential pipe (and rev gains)\n\u2022 AJ Tennant at Glean talked about this at SaaStr \u2014 when building horizontal enterprise products, knowing how to move left and right, up and down between functions is critical.\n\n3. C-suite sponsorship is a game-changer. \n\n\u2022 Too many deals stall out below the power line. Get above the line, early.\u00a0\n\u2022 Leaders often wait until the final stages, when their competitor is already there.\u00a0\n\u2022 Matthew O'Connor from Salesforce says it well \u2014 \u201cGo up and you can start adding zeros to your ACV\u201d\n\n4. Call prep is more than just knowing names \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s essential \n\n\u2022 Successful teams deeply understand every participant\n\u2022 A lack of detailed prep shows, and prevents real discovery\u00a0\n\u2022 Sae Ro from Moveworks and \ud83c\udfc0 Stephen Oommen say it\u2019s all about relationships \u2014 you need to understand individual priorities both in and outside of the business before jumping on with a customer\n\n5. Change your mindset from single player to multiplayer mode \n\n\u2022 Top teams operate as a unit, not individuals\u00a0\n\u2022 Revenue growth \u2014\u00a0especially in enterprise \u2014\u00a0comes from collective effort, not isolated wins\u00a0\n\u2022 Haley Katsman led the charge on team selling and multi-threading at Highspot, taking them from $0 to Series F\n\n6. Involving procurement early can save a deal \n\n\u2022 Most teams treat procurement as an afterthought but getting them involved early can be the difference between a win and a loss\u00a0\n\u2022 Zai Mohammed, MBA, LSSBB at Talkdesk encourages teams to understand that procurement isn\u2019t the final boss, but the folks you bring along from the very beginning.\n\nMy biggest takeaway from all this:\n\n\ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e.\n\nThe days of relying on one persona to close are over.\n\nBy engaging 3+ personas with power, you can 6.8x your win rates. Team selling and multiplayer mode is how you get there.\n\nThe next generation of overachieving GTM teams won\u2019t win using \"old school\" tactics or tools...\n\nThey\u2019ll win with a focus on relationships, org charts, and multi-threading EVERY deal from day 1.", "time": "3 weeks ago", "urn": "7250494104055267330"}, {"images": [], "num_appreciations": 1, "num_comments": 17, "num_empathy": 12, "num_likes": 47, "num_praises": 2, "num_reposts": 3, "post_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7250146561823793152/", "posted": "2024-10-10 14:14:01", "poster_linkedin_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachitkataria", "reshared": false, "text": "It\u2019s 2024.

Traditional outbound is under siege.\n\nSoon, no one will want to open their inbox anymore. Even if there are hidden gems between the noise.\n\nSo how do you adapt in this evolving landscape?\n\nWell.. outbound may be dead. It may still be alive. What\u2019s much more compelling to me is: what comes after?\n\nWhat do you need to do with all of those in-flight deals to succeed?\n\nTo close deals, especially in enterprise, you need more than just a cold email blast.

It should lead to closing more deals. Here\u2019s how to ~7x your win rate with one underutilized strategy:\n\nAdd 3 key personas to your deal.\n\nMulti-thread.\n\nA few weeks ago at Dreamforce, we had the pleasure of meeting Haley Katsman, Highspot\u2019s VP of Global Strategic Accounts. She was also their 14th employee and 1st SDR \u2014\u00a0a certified sales legend.\n\nShe led their multi-threading initiative and shared a WILD stat about her org: accounts with 1 contact have a single digit win rate of 9% but, with 3+ personas, rates skyrocket to 62% \ud83e\udd2f\n\nA 6.8x improvement. Let that sink in.\n\nSo why isn\u2019t everyone like Highspot (besides not having Haley)?\n\nBecause traditional account mapping is complex and time-consuming. You have to spend hours across LinkedIn and Salesforce, trying to piece together contacts on an org chart in Powerpoint or Miro.\n\nOnly to end up with something outdated within weeks.\n\nLeaders aren\u2019t intentionally trying to waste your time \u2014 the best AEs recognize that effective org charting statistically increases success. But current methods are entirely manual and tedious.\n\nSo it becomes a chore.\n\nI\u2019m with you. No one wants to spend hours trying to figure out \"who's who\u201d from outdated profiles when you\u2019d rather be selling. \n\nIt\u2019s not scalable. There has to be a better way.\n\nThat\u2019s why we built Centralize (YC W24). \n\nWith Centralize, reps & leaders get automatically generated org charts of every decision-maker, along with actionable insights to multi-thread deals effectively. \n\nWe guide you to exactly who you need to talk to next and which deals are at risk because you\u2019re single threaded.\n\nSpeed up your sales process. Avoid deals getting derailed on the 1-yard line. Close bigger deals, more.\n\nWhat\u2019s been your experience with account mapping?\n\nP.S.

Relationships that pave the way for future growth and repeat business.\n\nLet\u2019s be real.\n\nA foot in the door is a win, but there are 8 more steps after that first touch. And if you stop with just one contact, you\u2019re flying blind.\n\nThat\u2019s where multi-threading comes in.\n\nWhen you land that first champion, don\u2019t make the mistake of stopping there.

It\u2019s Q4. Crunch time.\n\nEvery deal is critical, and everyone in GTM (sales, success, marketing) needs to be on the same page. You\u2019ve got to know: Who\u2019s in the deal? Who\u2019s important? Who can block it?\n\nA week ago, I read a post from Matt Green that said that AMs and CSMs reps should just straight up ask for an org chart. \n\nHe\u2019s right \u2014 if you can get it, it\u2019s a compass to the relationships you have to carefully build over the lifetime of the account. Whether that\u2019s during disco or in person at conferences. \n\nAt Dreamforce and SaaStr, I felt this first hand. It reminded me how small moments can make a big difference.\n\nBut here\u2019s the reality: you\u2019re most likely going to lose 40-50% of the deals in your pipeline.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause you\u2019re missing the right people. The ones with decision-making power, the ones who can influence the outcome, or the ones who will throw up roadblocks.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about who\u2019s on your side \u2014 you need to know who isn\u2019t.\n\nBuilding rapport and trust in those small, meaningful ways is crucial.\n\nYou never know how a 5-10 second interaction could positively \u2014 or negatively \u2014 impact the deal unless you\u2019re thinking about every little thing.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s the CEO you never engaged, or the VP you didn\u2019t realize was a detractor until the final hour. These are the people who stop deals in their tracks.\n\nKnowing who\u2019s against you is just as important as knowing who\u2019s in your corner.\n\nIf you can map out that landscape every step of the way during these 4-6 month deal cycles, your team will have a strategic roadmap to navigate the deal. You\u2019ll have every advantage to move from that 40-50% loss rate to zero.\n\nThe bottom line: Identify the blockers, hold yourself accountable, win the deal. \n\nPS: I\u2019ll put a link to Matt\u2019s post in the comments for you", "time": "1 month ago", "urn": "7244357014334685186", "video": {"duration": 82000, "stream_url": "https://dms.licdn.com/playlist/vid/v2/D5605AQH7EBT03GKseQ/mp4-720p-30fp-crf28/mp4-720p-30fp-crf28/0/1727189303780?e=1731524400&v=beta&t=wGJxsWCmED-J64vS6CBMN29tFLTAY8lasnb_DgLGFHA"}}, {"images": [{"url": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQGZXc8eN3BZuQ/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1726792567511?e=1733961600&v=beta&t=pqIQSiwHUfZa779XAsYdz1hfOZ456OldRa80e5FBoIY"}, {"url": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQGNnL2ijqonsQ/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1726792577357?e=1733961600&v=beta&t=zRS0mMlWBdOreXnLmD6ton6EEQzQ17IEHEfYh9F-HxY"}, {"url": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQFZwfoRW-CeVw/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1726792571337?e=1733961600&v=beta&t=wXi-BxRPEbSYB1QPo3EZa9fXbUHrYEEmp3ohyy9F6t8"}, {"url": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQHPOx9F97BKaQ/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1726792575242?e=1733961600&v=beta&t=iwKcm9_6N2ildj0QC9spsGNm_i-fxquo4Oj_GrlUNSg"}, {"url": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQEvYrVMWrS1Mw/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1726792575192?e=1733961600&v=beta&t=vy3foyjOWvgEXJ9dGma7_iznpbe0qz4_bbjU0Geg-lw"}], "num_appreciations": 1, "num_comments": 2, "num_empathy": 7, "num_likes": 83, "num_praises": 4, "num_reposts": 4, "post_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7242925262458257408/", "posted": "2024-09-20 15:59:09", "poster_linkedin_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/salesforce-ventures", "reshared": true, "text": "And that's a wrap on #Dreamforce2024! \ud83c\udf1f\n\nWhat an incredible final day of insights from our portfolio founders and industry leaders.

You have to nurture each tiny seed into a blossoming rose (or onion) and that takes time, energy, and effort.\n\nSales isn't far off at all from gardening. The best teams know that deals are not won at the account level, but at the individual level.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy\u2014you need to understand their pains and needs. You need to know where they fit into the organization and work with them to find the other key people who will ultimately help you help them.\n\nThat's sales. Saying the right thing, to the right person, at the right time. And that's damn hard to manage at scale. To get your entire org on the same page and on the same team to win faster.\n\n10s of contacts at every customer x Conversations across several internal teammates x 100s of opportunities = \ud83e\udd2f\n\nHere's the good news: the Centralize (YC W24) gardeners are here to save the day \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udf3e\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udf3e \n\nYou've probably seen us running around Dreamforce this week, hugging folks and handing out free seeds.

A seriously special team they've got going there. Ran into one of Salesforce\u2019s best AEs there as well, Nina Zarour and learned a lot about enterprise relationship building. \n\n4/ Modern Sales Pros: Jam-packed vibe with fellow YC founders like Dori Wilson, Sriharsha Guduguntla and Atul Raghunathan mingling with great revenue leaders. Bumped into Peter Mollins at Nooks again post-SaaStr.\n\nPhew what a day. Time to run it back for Day 2!

The R in your CRM needs serious help. Here\u2019s why:\n\n90% of Fortune 500s use Salesforce. For all the flak they get, SFDC\u2019s $243B market cap doesn\u2019t lie. Marc Benioff and Parker Harris have built one of the most impactful SaaS products of all time. Shout out to the incredible folks in our network who\u2019ve helped build that empire:\u00a0Cal Henderson Matthew O'Connor Joe Teplow Vanessa Gatihi AJ Tennant Junan Pang Dave Macnee Avanthika R.\n\nBut here\u2019s the reality: 99% of RevOps teams are spending a fortune \u2014 6 to 8 figures \u2014 on what\u2019s essentially a powerful database..\n\nAnd what do you get for all that money? A repository of names, contacts, and companies \u2014\u00a0most of which are outdated. People who don\u2019t even work at those companies anymore.\n\nSure, tools like Gong and Chorus capture conversations and push some data into Salesforce, but it\u2019s far from the full picture. In fact, they often add to the clutter.\n\nAnd what are you left with? A sea of names, emails, and transcripts to sift through without true relationship management.\n\nNow, imagine this: \n\nA platform that finally makes your CRM work for you. One that turns your sprawling database into a clear, concise view of every account\u2019s decision-makers and conversations \u2014 in seconds.

Our cofounders in Retell, coming from diverse backgrounds at companies like Google, Meta, and TikTok, bring a variety of styles and cultures to the table. At Retell, we've placed a strong emphasis on building a healthy cofounder relationship and establishing a new team culture.\n\nBeyond the essential trust we share, which serves as our foundation, we've implemented specific processes to enhance communication. Among these, our bi-weekly retrospectives stand out. These sessions are dedicated to acknowledging achievements, expressing gratitude, and reflecting on our successes and areas for improvement.\n\n\ud83c\udf89 Celebrating Achievements: In the hustle of building and creating, it's easy to overlook the milestones we achieve. Taking time to celebrate these moments not only boosts morale but also reminds us of our collective progress.\n\n\ud83d\ude4f Shoutouts: Despite working closely, we sometimes miss opportunities to express our appreciation. For instance, receiving thanks from my colleagues for finding a great apartment for the team was a proud moment. It underscored the value of recognizing the efforts we each put in.\n\n\u2615 Reflecting on Successes and Areas for Improvement: It's crucial to vocalize our successes and formalize them into processes that ensure continued success. Equally important is creating a space where the team can discuss what didn't work and collaboratively develop action plans for improvement.\n\nI strongly advocate for conducting regular retrospectives with your cofounders.

At Meta, I met many talented individuals, shipped impactful projects, and experienced tremendous growth. Here are the three most significant things I learned from Meta:\n\n1. Every Superpower Comes with a Shadow\nStrength can sometimes accompany weakness. For instance, if you're adept at moving fast, self-driven, and excel in growth, you might be less meticulous in system design and find it challenging to navigate in top-down structured organizations like Ads. Great collaborators, who are loved for their team spirit, might struggle with conflict resolution or shy away from making hard decisions. Early in your career, it's important to understand your strengths and position yourself to maximize them. Later, ensure your superpower doesn't overshadow your weaknesses. It's vital to seek feedback in these areas for well-rounded growth.\n\n2. Influence Without Authority\nLearning how to influence others, even when you're not their manager or don't have the authority, is crucial. To collaborate effectively with other teams, find solutions that benefit both teams' metrics, making collaboration much smoother. When helping peers, consider how it can positively impact their performance reviews and create a win-win situation.\n\n3. Listen with Curiosity\nWhen someone proposes a solution different from yours, instead of immediately defending yourself, first listen and understand their reasoning. Ask questions - in the process, they might discover flaws in their solution, or you might realize theirs is better. In 1:1s, if someone expresses doubts about our roadmap, instead of dominating the conversation, listen to their concerns first. This approach can help you address their issues more effectively.\n\nI really love the fast-paced, engineering-driven, and bottom-up culture at Meta.

From Fortune 500 companies to small businesses, managing contractual obligations remains a manual, error-prone, and costly task, dragging down efficiency and creating potential legal liabilities. \n\nThe way contracts are managed today\u2014across creation, execution, and expiration\u2014is bogged down by bureaucracy, delays, and the ever-present risk of litigation or regulatory breaches. It\u2019s an inefficient system desperately in need of disruption.\n\nThe goal of Delos is to build the future\u2019s infrastructure for Autonomous Contracts - contracts automatically executed when agreed terms and conditions are met.\n\nIn doing so, I want to not only reduce the costs of handling contracts, but also propose a path forward to reducing the bureaucracy that burdens our societies.\n\nWe\u2019re just getting started, and we invite you to read more about our mission.\n\nLet\u2019s transform the way the world manages agreements\u2014and unlock unprecedented speed in doing business.", "time": "1 month ago", "urn": "7249478667704164352"}, {"images": [{"url": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQFeaUGLUcszuw/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1728275862446?e=1733961600&v=beta&t=0y7bz_Vu11HQBQzTmuelZWM8Vb8Inhmy4mccwcYqHo8"}], "num_comments": 11, "num_empathy": 10, "num_interests": 3, "num_likes": 208, "num_praises": 25, "num_reposts": 10, "post_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7249086265390723074/", "posted": "2024-10-07 16:00:47", "poster_linkedin_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/berkeleymeng", "reshared": false, "text": "\u2744 \u2744  We are excited to announce that Roe AI has officially been accepted to Snowflake's Native App Accelerator.

Here\u2019s what \u201cfounder mode\u201d means to me:\n\nWhen I became CEO of Snowflake, I understood the importance of a relentless growth mindset. What worked yesterday may not work today. To be a high growth company, you need to reinvent constantly for the new reality, and complacency is not an option. \n\nTo achieve this level of dynamism, accountability and transparency are non-negotiable. Accountability means setting clear objectives and rigorously tracking progress. I ask my teams for daily updates on our key goals\u2014whether it\u2019s sales, product delivery, or company OKRs. This keeps us proactive, addressing potential issues before they escalate and ensuring we stay true to our commitments. It\u2019s not about micromanagement, it\u2019s about everyone feeling involved and accountable. While we embrace risk, we dig deep early and often, making adjustments as needed.\n\nTransparency means that everyone should operate with the same information. There is no \u201cmanaging up\u201d at Snowflake. Decisions are made as a team, with everyone holding equal information. And our conclusions are based on facts rather than opinions. I firmly believe you must \u201ctrust but verify\u201d - this helps us make decisions in predictable ways. \n\nFinally, growth depends on investing in people and providing opportunities. We\u2019ve all reached our positions because someone took a chance on us. When hiring, I prioritize drive and adaptability. I seek team players who are committed to collective success, rather than individual gain.

Let's take a look at an article that made some waves last week...\n\nAs the title implies, the article is about hedge funds using AI and underperforming the market, and I'm in complete disagreement with it.\n\nThe basis for the article is the Eurekahedge AI Hedge Fund Index, which the article quotes \u201cis designed to provide a broad measure of the performance of underlying hedge fund managers who utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning theory in their trading processes.\u201d That index has not beat the S&P 500 over the last 15 years.\n\nI'm going to be charitable and focus on LLMs and Gen AI. In reality, I find it hard to believe that *any* large hedge funds are not using some form of AI or ML in their processes - seriously, no NLP, not even linear regression? But let's imagine a fictitious Index that tracks only funds using LLMs and Gen AI. I would still find that article hard to believe. \n\nWhy? \n\n1) LLMs save time, lots of time. We built a chatbot to help answer questions around broad trends in the earnings transcripts of the Russell 3k. What companies are worried about recesions? Why? What are the themes? A human could already do this by reading all 3000 of those transcripts but the chatbot saves hours and hours of work. Obviously that leaves more time for idea generation and other productive work. \n\n2) One layer deeper, LLMs can extract insights from text at scale. That's more than just a time saver - it means a sector analyst can explore and create features that previously would have required serious NLP resources, and those NLP resources are finite. For example, we did this with ESG risk metrics flagged in 10Qs and in two days created a new risk scale from -2 to +2 on ESG impact to business. \n\n3) Risk and anomaly detection. Risk can arrive in my forms and often times that risk is buried in regulatory or compliance alerts, or vendor alerts around data changes. We have an upcoming case study around this where a trading platform built an amazing system for identifying vendor risk that could be lurking in the thousands of alert emails that arrive every year. Find risks faster and mitigate/avoid them.\n\nMore time, more features, better risk management powered by LLMs and Gen AI. I'm not seeing how those lead to underperformance.\n\nHave a good Sunday,\u00a0\nJR\n\ncc Alexander Fleiss maybe we'll discuss this at the conference!", "time": "2 months ago", "urn": "7236042823853117440"}, {"images": [], "num_comments": 1, "num_interests": 2, "num_likes": 65, "num_praises": 3, "num_reposts": 0, "post_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7235304826052489216/", "posted": "2024-08-30 15:18:15", "poster_linkedin_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/berkeleymeng", "reshared": false, "text": "\ud83d\udea8 Friday Demo Day: How to answer ANY questions from ANY number of documents?
